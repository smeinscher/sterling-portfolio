            Hi, I'm Sterling Meinscher, a software developer with experience in mobile and game development. My tech journey began as a Data Curator, before transitioning into DevOps and Quality Assurance. Eventually, I moved into mobile development, specializing in React Native and TypeScript, where I contributed to GM's vehicle app, building features and improving user experiences.

            Beyond my professional experience, I have a deep interest in graphics programming and game development. In my free time, I work on cstrl, a game framework written in C and OpenGL. I've already built some simple games with it and am currently developing a Moon RTS game. To push my understanding of graphics further, I've also been exploring Vulkan, though it's still a work in progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently live in Austin, Texas, where I balance my love for coding with training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and hanging out with my three awesome cats.

            Feel free to check out my work and connectâ€”I'd love to collaborate or talk tech!
